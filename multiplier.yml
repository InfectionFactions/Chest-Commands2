This will just be a command masking plugin.

If a player runs:  /mp set 2.0
It run the command through console as: /asa setmultiplier %player% 2.0 0

You must have the permissions: multiplier.2
If you dont have the permission it tell the person running the command:
&8[&eOG&8] &7You must purchase this multiplier to use it! &8(&e/buy&8)

There are 3 multipliers all together so there's,
2.0, 3.0 and 4.0
